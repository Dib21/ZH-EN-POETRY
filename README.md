# ZH-EN-POETRY
Experiment with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies to guide an LLM in the task of translating from English into a low-resource language, Chinese. 
The project focuses on the accuracy of the final output, not only in
terms of syntax or standard usage of the target language, but also in terms of the
intercultural validity of the translation, with the goal of critically evaluating the model’s
Step-by-Step reasoning capabilities in such a complex task as translation of poems, and,
where possible, observing the sociocultural transitions made by the model.
